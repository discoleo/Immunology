Analysis by Leonard Mada

Eukaryotic cells can undergo division either through mitosis or through meiosis.


## Meiotic Pathway

**Hypothesis:**\
Cancer cells activate the meiotic pathway or parts of it, e.g. the sister chromatid exchange pathway.

This activation (or partial activation) of the meiotic pathway may play an important role in the genetic instability of tumour cells.

## Tumour Immunity

### Anti-Viral Response

**Hypothesis:**\
The genetic instability may mimic a viral infection, leading to activation of the type-1 Interferon pathway. This type-1 IFN pathway may induce an antiviral-type immune response in the tumour. This response is **not** a true immune response against the cancer cells, but was induced by the activation of the IFN type 1 pathway inside the tumour cells.
