# Tumour Models

One major fallacy in the classic approach to immunotherapies is the assumption that tumour cells are immunogenic. Even if the tumour contains mutations in the coding region of genes, which induce the expression of various neoantigens, these mutations may have arisen over a longer period of time. Furthermore, almost all cells in an older adult have accumulated a substantial set of mutations over the lifespan of that individual. Identical, or similar mutations may be already present in multiple cells across the body. Consequently, the immune system may have become tolerant over time to these mutations.

The tumorigenesis process involves usually multiple genetic hits, before a cell becomes fully malignant. The intermediate cells may have already expressed some of the neoantigens: the induction of immune tolerance is probably a continuous process that was already happening during the early phases of the tumour genesis and this tolerance may be well established by the time the cells have acquired all characteristics (mutations) of malignancy.

Various animal models are used to study immunotherapies in solid tumours. Unfortunately, many of these models are poor models to study immune processes against cancers arising in adults or older people.

## Mouse Models

Mouse models are actually a poor immunological model for solid tumours originating in adults. I will skip over the differences between the mouse and human immune systems and will focus instead on a set of hidden conceptual issues.

The life span of mice is very short compared to the age when tumours arise in adults. Thus, mice will never accumulate the mutations that a normal older adult will harbour. Adults who develop cancer probably have a similar (relatively) high burden of mutations and the immune system has come into contact with these mutations, ultimately developing at least some level of tolerance.

Mice are probably a better model for paediatric malignancies.
